                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>Triton Rocket Club is an undergraduate-led team that designs 
                    and launches advanced rockets. The club was founded in fall 
                    2011 to aid students interested in rocketry to gain 
                    practical and technical experience as well as help them 
                    attain the necessary skills and connections to get 
                    internships. Currently, the Triton Rocket Club continues to 
                    give students an opportunity to apply the knowledge they 
                    have learned in the classroom to real world projects.</p>

            	<h2>How to Join</h2>
            	<p>There is a $15 membership fee to join the Triton Rocket Club. 
                    This membership fee is to cover the costs of parts, 
                    equipment, and other TRC expenses. Prospective members are 
                    encouraged to participate in the general body and team 
                    meetings to help make the decision about whether they want 
                    to commit or not. These meetings are a discussion of what 
                    the group is doing and what direction they want to head in. 
                    Non-members are allowed to attend any meetings and one build 
                    day in order to encourage immediate involvement in the
